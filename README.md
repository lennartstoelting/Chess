the empty board can now kind of be filled with some chess pieces. it is still very static but you will see a pawn appearing in the top right corner. Changing this currently takes many steps so a different approach is on the way

The whole thing is currently just able to draw an empty board, not even connected with the Board class, just a static board
There are a lot of different classes to give a general structure but this concept has to be revisited very soon in order to start everything correctly
Next Step will be to further work on the GUI, get it running so that it can be visually used
